<!--Our application is a web app. It has a public facing interface, and a doctor/healthcare worker facing interface. Users can search through a database of previously asked questions about COVID-19 (or add their question to the database if it hasn't already been asked), and obtain answers from medical professionals around the globe.

## About The Project

SARS-COV-2 is spreading around the globe at a frighteningly rapid pace. This war continues to hold humanity hostage with fear and social isolation. COVID-19 is one of the greatest threats we have ever faced. The fight against COVID-19 will take place outside of healthcare through the pairing of artificial intelligence and blockchain, utilizing globally connected machines with algorithms that can propagate and move faster than the virus. Our traditional ways of using research, trials, policies, and tried-and-true therapies are not fast enough and have not been able to slow the destruction of COVID-19.
<br>

<b>Who are we?</b><br>
Three technology companies — <b>SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol and Nth Opinion </b> — have joined efforts to utilize the latest technologies to outpace the spread of the virus. </p>

<b>What are we building together?</b><br>
The grassroots open-source team behind AskCo19.com is excited to partner with SingularityNET to merge decentralized protocols, communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.


<b>How are we building it?</b><br>
With a collaborative effort, we are building a solution intensive web application that facilitates the integration of modern technologies, with the expertise of a wide cross section of volunteers. Integrating powerful human characteristics to coalesce awareness, foresight, compassion and wisdom to guide decision making.

We are a technological species that has been undergoing a revolution with our abilities to wield artificial intelligence and blockchain, we can extinguish this threat with the power of innovations that are self-adapting, borderless, decentralized, and defend us without permission. We aim to accomplish this by applying the use of decentralized protocols, communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning through a collaborative approach.

<b>Why are we doing this?</b><br>
We believe this partnership enables real-time sharing of critical understanding and insights on how to overcome COVID-19 with treatments, techniques, therapies, and agents from people for people across the globe.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->


<b>NOTICE:</b> This open source project is a work in progress. The best way to get onboarded and brought up to speed is to participate in our Slack channel:

<!--
<i>Update March 15, 2020:</i> Please excuse the bugs as we are working hard to fix them on the fly! COVID-19 is spreading faster than we can code and as a result converted the project to open source overnight. We understand there are bugs and the code is not optimized. Thank you for working with us as we adapt in real-time! Don’t be shy, reach out, and get involved.-->

### Built With

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

The COVIDATHON project is a monorepo. The server code is inside the `api` folder and the client code is inside the `client` folder.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Navigate to the repository where you want to install the project
2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:nthopinion/covidathon.git
```

3. To setup the `api`, check the [README](/webapi) inside the `api` folder.
4. To setup the `client`, check the [README](/webapp) inside the `client` folder.

<!-- TEST
TODO: Add more to the testing workflow: how to write a test, where, etc.
 -->

## Test

Testing is important in order to make sure your feature is meeting all the requirements.
Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode by running the npm command<br />

```sh
npm test
```
